# Pointer Events Migration - COMPLETED ✅

> **Status**: Migration completed and all follow-up issues resolved
> **Completion Date**: 2025-10-01
> **Original Migration**: PR #45
> **Follow-up Fixes**: PR #47, PR #49

## Migration Summary

The Designer has been successfully migrated from mouse events to the modern Pointer Events API. This migration provides better reliability, touch/pen support, and eliminates event listener leaks.

### Issues Resolved
- ✅ Event listener leaks eliminated via pointer capture
- ✅ Touch/pen support added
- ✅ Improved reliability with `pointercancel` handling
- ✅ All UI components updated to prevent event bubbling issues

---

## Original Plan: Mouse Events Implementation

The Designer currently uses the traditional mouse event pattern:
- `mousedown` on canvas/widgets
- `mousemove` on document (added dynamically)
- `mouseup` on document (added dynamically)

### Known Issues with Current Approach

1. **Event Listener Leaks** - If `mouseup` never fires (mouse released outside window), document listeners remain attached
2. **No Touch Support** - Only works with mouse, not touch devices
3. **No Pen Support** - Doesn't handle stylus/pen input
4. **Missing Edge Cases** - No handling for pointer cancellation (e.g., browser loses focus)

## Pointer Events API: Modern Best Practice

### What Are Pointer Events?

Pointer Events unify mouse, touch, and pen input into a single event model:
- `pointerdown` - Pointer becomes active
- `pointermove` - Pointer moves
- `pointerup` - Pointer is released
- **`pointercancel`** - Pointer is interrupted (this is the key advantage!)

### Browser Support

✅ **Excellent** - Supported in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 55+ (2016)
- Firefox 59+ (2018)
- Safari 13+ (2019)
- Edge 12+ (2015)

## Migration Analysis

### Current Event Flow

```typescript
// designer-drag.ts
handleCanvasMouseDown(e: MouseEvent) {
    // 1. Determine drag type (move/resize/select)
    // 2. Store drag state
    // 3. Add document listeners
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', this.boundMouseMoveHandler);
    document.addEventListener('mouseup', this.boundMouseUpHandler);
}

handleDocumentMouseUp(e: MouseEvent) {
    // 1. Finalize operation (create command)
    // 2. Remove document listeners
    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', this.boundMouseMoveHandler);
    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', this.boundMouseUpHandler);
    // 3. Clear drag state
}
```

**Problem**: If `mouseup` doesn't fire, listeners stay attached forever.

### Proposed Pointer Events Flow

```typescript
// designer-drag.ts (migrated)
handleCanvasPointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
    // 1. Capture the pointer (ensures all events come to this element)
    this.canvasElement.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);

    // 2. Determine drag type (move/resize/select)
    // 3. Store drag state with pointer ID
    this.dragState = {
        pointerId: e.pointerId,  // Track which pointer
        type: DragType.Move,
        // ... rest of state
    };

    // 4. Add listeners to CANVAS (not document) - capture takes care of routing
    this.canvasElement.addEventListener('pointermove', this.boundPointerMoveHandler);
    this.canvasElement.addEventListener('pointerup', this.boundPointerUpHandler);
    this.canvasElement.addEventListener('pointercancel', this.boundPointerCancelHandler);
}

handleCanvasPointerUp(e: PointerEvent) {
    if (!this.dragState || this.dragState.pointerId !== e.pointerId) return;

    // 1. Finalize operation (create command)
    // 2. Release pointer capture
    this.canvasElement.releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId);
    // 3. Remove listeners
    this.cleanupPointerListeners();
    // 4. Clear drag state
}

handleCanvasPointerCancel(e: PointerEvent) {
    // THIS IS THE KEY IMPROVEMENT!
    // Fires when pointer is interrupted (e.g., browser alert, tab switch)
    if (!this.dragState || this.dragState.pointerId !== e.pointerId) return;

    // 1. Abort operation (revert to original state)
    this.revertDragOperation();
    // 2. Release pointer capture
    this.canvasElement.releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId);
    // 3. Remove listeners
    this.cleanupPointerListeners();
    // 4. Clear drag state
}
```

## Key Advantages

### 1. Pointer Capture Eliminates Need for Document Listeners

```typescript
// OLD: Document listeners can leak
document.addEventListener('mousemove', handler);  // Risky!

// NEW: Canvas listeners with capture - automatically cleaned up
element.setPointerCapture(pointerId);  // Routes all events to element
element.addEventListener('pointermove', handler);  // Safe, scoped to element
```

### 2. Built-in Interruption Handling

`pointercancel` fires automatically when:
- Browser window loses focus
- Alert/dialog appears
- User switches tabs
- Touch is interrupted by system gesture
- Pointer is captured by another element

**No more safety timeouts needed!**

### 3. Multi-Touch Support (Future)

Pointer events support multiple simultaneous pointers:
```typescript
// Track multiple pointers by ID
const activePointers = new Map<number, DragState>();

handlePointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
    activePointers.set(e.pointerId, { /* state */ });
}
```

### 4. Better Performance

- Events attached to canvas, not document (fewer event bubbles)
- Pointer capture is hardware-accelerated
- Fewer event listener attach/detach operations

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Core Event Migration (Low Risk)
- [ ] Replace `mousedown` → `pointerdown`
- [ ] Replace `mousemove` → `pointermove`
- [ ] Replace `mouseup` → `pointerup`
- [ ] Add `pointercancel` handler
- [ ] Test on mouse input (should be identical)

### Phase 2: Pointer Capture (Medium Risk)
- [ ] Implement `setPointerCapture()` in pointer down
- [ ] Implement `releasePointerCapture()` in pointer up/cancel
- [ ] Move listeners from document to canvas element
- [ ] Test pointer-outside-window scenarios
- [ ] Verify no listener leaks in DevTools

### Phase 3: Cleanup & Enhancement (Low Risk)
- [ ] Remove safety timeout fallbacks (no longer needed)
- [ ] Add pointer type detection (`e.pointerType: 'mouse' | 'touch' | 'pen'`)
- [ ] Add pressure sensitivity for pen input (optional)
- [ ] Test on touch devices (tablets/phones)
- [ ] Test on devices with pen input (Surface, iPad Pro)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] Multi-touch support for multi-widget selection
- [ ] Pressure-based brush size (if drawing features added)
- [ ] Touch gesture support (pinch to zoom, rotate)

## Code Changes Required

### Files to Modify

1. **`src/designer/core/designer-drag.ts`**
   - Change event types: `MouseEvent` → `PointerEvent`
   - Add `pointerId` to `DragState` interface
   - Implement `pointercancel` handler
   - Replace document listeners with captured canvas listeners

2. **`src/designer/widget.ts`**
   - Update resize handle events: `mousedown` → `pointerdown`
   - Pass `PointerEvent` to resize handler

3. **`src/designer/selection-manager.ts`**
   - Remove safety timeout (no longer needed with `pointercancel`)
   - Update any mouse-specific logic

4. **`src/designer/types.ts`**
   - Add `pointerId?: number` to `DragState` interface

### Breaking Changes

**None** - Pointer events are backwards compatible. Existing mouse input works identically.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Mock PointerEvent
const createPointerEvent = (type: string, props: any) => {
    return new PointerEvent(type, {
        pointerId: 1,
        pointerType: 'mouse',
        ...props
    });
};

it('should clean up on pointercancel', () => {
    const down = createPointerEvent('pointerdown', { clientX: 100, clientY: 100 });
    designer.handlePointerDown(down);

    const cancel = createPointerEvent('pointercancel', { pointerId: 1 });
    designer.handlePointerCancel(cancel);

    // Verify cleanup
    expect(designer.dragState).toBeNull();
});
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Mouse outside window** - Drag widget, move mouse outside browser, release → Should cancel cleanly
2. **Browser alert** - Start drag, trigger alert() → Should cancel operation
3. **Tab switch** - Start drag, Cmd+Tab to switch apps → Should cancel
4. **Touch device** - Test on iPad/tablet with touch input
5. **Stylus** - Test with Apple Pencil or Surface Pen

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1**: 2-4 hours (basic migration)
- **Phase 2**: 4-6 hours (pointer capture implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 hours (cleanup and testing)
- **Phase 4**: 8-16 hours (optional advanced features)

**Total Core Migration**: 8-13 hours

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert commits (migration is isolated to event handling)
2. Fall back to current mouse events + safety timeouts
3. No data loss risk (only affects event handling)

## Recommended Approach

### Option A: Full Migration (Recommended)
- Implement all of Phase 1-3
- Modern, clean solution
- Eliminates safety timeouts entirely
- Future-proof for touch/pen

### Option B: Hybrid Approach
- Keep current mouse events
- Add `pointercancel` polyfill for edge cases
- Keep safety timeouts as secondary fallback
- Less work, but doesn't get full benefits

### Option C: Status Quo
- Keep current implementation
- Rely on safety timeouts
- Works, but not best practice
- May have edge cases

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Option A (Full Migration)**

Reasons:
1. **Better reliability** - `pointercancel` is more reliable than timeouts
2. **Future-proof** - Touch/pen support built-in
3. **Cleaner code** - No need for safety net timeouts
4. **Low risk** - Pointer events are well-supported and backwards compatible
5. **Modest effort** - 8-13 hours for significant improvement

This should be a separate issue/PR after #42 is tested and merged.

## Post-Migration Updates

### Migration Completed (PR #45)

The pointer events migration was completed successfully with the following changes:

**Core Changes:**
- Migrated all drag-and-drop operations to use `PointerEvent` instead of `MouseEvent`
- Implemented pointer capture for reliable event handling
- Added comprehensive `pointercancel` handler for interruption scenarios
- Removed safety timeout fallbacks (no longer needed)
- Added permanent debug panel for real-time monitoring

**Files Modified:**
- `types.ts` - Added `pointerId` to `DragState`
- `designer-drag.ts` - Full pointer events migration
- `widget.ts` - Updated resize handles to use `pointerdown`
- `designer-core.ts` - Updated bound handlers and debug info
- `designer-events.ts` - Canvas listener changed to `pointerdown`
- `Designer.cshtml` - Added debug panel HTML
- `designer.css` - Added debug panel styling

### Follow-Up Issue #46: Toolbar Buttons Not Working (PR #47)

**Problem:**
After migration, clicking object creation buttons (text, box, QR code) in the toolbar did not work.

**Root Cause:**
- The toolbar is moved to the canvas as a child element via `registerToolbox()`
- The canvas listens for `pointerdown` events to handle drag operations
- `toolbox-manager.ts` only prevented `mousedown` events from bubbling, not `pointerdown`
- Button clicks triggered the canvas's `pointerdown` handler, preventing the button click event

**Solution:**
Added `pointerdown` event listener to toolbox elements in `toolbox-manager.ts` that calls `stopPropagation()` to prevent events from bubbling to the canvas.

**Files Modified:**
- `Yuzu.Web/src/designer/toolbox-manager.ts` - Added pointerdown handler (lines 69-75)

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Prevent pointerdown events on the toolbox from triggering canvas events
element.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e: PointerEvent) => {
    // Stop propagation to prevent canvas from handling this event
    e.stopPropagation();
});
```

### Follow-Up Issue #48: Properties Panel Controls Disabled (PR #49)

**Problem:**
Clicking controls in the properties panel (sliders, dropdowns, etc.) caused them to immediately become disabled.

**Root Cause:**
- Same pattern as #46 - properties panel moved to canvas as child element
- `properties-manager.ts` only prevented `mousedown` events from bubbling
- Clicking properties controls → `pointerdown` bubbles to canvas → canvas deselects widgets → properties panel disables controls

**Solution:**
Added `pointerdown` event listener to properties toolbox in `properties-manager.ts` that calls `stopPropagation()`.

**Files Modified:**
- `Yuzu.Web/src/designer/properties-manager.ts` - Added pointerdown handler (lines 75-79)

**Code Change:**
```typescript
this.propertiesToolbox.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e: PointerEvent) => {
    // Stop propagation to prevent canvas from handling this event
    // This is critical - without this, clicking controls causes the canvas to deselect widgets
    e.stopPropagation();
});
```

## Common Pattern: Event Bubbling to Canvas

Both follow-up issues shared the same root cause:

1. **Canvas listens for `pointerdown`** - After migration, the canvas uses `pointerdown` events for drag operations
2. **Child elements only stopped `mousedown`** - UI components (toolbars, panels) were only preventing `mousedown` from bubbling
3. **`pointerdown` bubbles up** - Pointer events from child elements reached the canvas handler
4. **Unexpected canvas behavior** - Canvas handler processed these events, causing unwanted side effects

**Solution Pattern:**
For any element that is a child of the canvas and has interactive controls, add both:
- `mousedown` event listener with `stopPropagation()` (for backward compatibility)
- `pointerdown` event listener with `stopPropagation()` (for pointer events)

## Audit Results

All interactive UI components in the Designer have been audited:

✅ **toolbox-manager.ts** - Has both `mousedown` and `pointerdown` handlers
✅ **properties-manager.ts** - Has both `mousedown` and `pointerdown` handlers
✅ **widget.ts** - Correctly uses `pointerdown` for resize handles
✅ **text-widget.ts** - Uses `dblclick` for editing (not affected)
✅ **main.ts** - Uses `click` events (not affected)

**No additional issues found.** The migration is complete and stable.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Event Migration Requires Full Audit** - When migrating from mouse to pointer events, all event handlers must be updated, not just the primary drag handlers

2. **`stopPropagation()` Must Match Event Type** - Calling `stopPropagation()` on `mousedown` doesn't stop `pointerdown` from bubbling

3. **Child Elements of Canvas Need Special Handling** - Any interactive element that is a child of the canvas must prevent both `mousedown` and `pointerdown` from bubbling

4. **Testing Should Cover All Interactive Elements** - Initial migration testing focused on drag operations but missed toolbar/panel interactions

## Final Status

✅ **Migration Complete**: All phases completed successfully
✅ **Issues Resolved**: All post-migration issues identified and fixed
✅ **Stable**: No known outstanding pointer events issues
✅ **Well-Documented**: All changes documented in PRs and this file

The Designer now uses modern pointer events throughout, with full support for mouse, touch, and pen input, plus robust handling of edge cases and interruptions.
